Purpose:  
Maintain design consistency and development flow across all frontend modules (chat, dashboard, leaderboard, scheduler, calendar, forms) in RevSales.  
All frontend is developed using **Livewire + Tailwind CSS** and must adhere strictly to these design guidelines.

---

## 🎨 1️⃣ Layout & Structure

✅ Always use **mobile-first responsive layouts** using Tailwind’s `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints  
✅ Use `flex`, `grid`, or `stacked column` layout styles — avoid absolute or hardcoded positioning  
✅ Page containers: use `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4`  
✅ Maintain vertical and horizontal padding: `p-4`, `px-6`, `py-3`  
✅ Livewire layout files (Blade components) should use consistent containers for page wrappers

❌ Avoid fixed pixel widths, inline styles, or margin hacks

---

## 🌈 2️⃣ Color Palette

🎨 Professional with soft gamified highlights:

- Light BG: `#f9fafb`  
- Dark BG: `#0f172a`  
- Primary Action (CTA): `#2563eb` (blue-600)  
- Success/XP: `#10b981` (green-500)  
- Danger/Error: `#ef4444` (red-500)  
- Highlight Reward: `#facc15` (yellow-400)  
- Neutral: `gray-200` to `gray-800` (Tailwind palette)

❌ Avoid neon, saturated gradients, harsh contrast  

---

## 🅰️ 3️⃣ Typography

✅ Use Tailwind’s `font-sans` (system font) globally  
✅ Font sizes:
- `text-xl` → Section titles  
- `text-base` → Regular content  
- `text-sm` → Labels  
- `text-xs` → Captions, timestamps  

✅ Spacing: `leading-relaxed` for content areas  
✅ Clickable text: `font-medium` or `font-semibold`

❌ Never use more than 2 font weights per view  
✅ Text areas in forms should use Livewire two-way binding (`wire:model`)
